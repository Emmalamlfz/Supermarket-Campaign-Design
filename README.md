This is one of the group projects that I've done in the National University of Singapore(NUS)
* We conducted customer segmentation by using clustering analysis on usersâ€™ behavioral and demographic data.
* Targeted to maintain customer relationship through customer loyalty analysis. Implemented RFM model to help company track customers and build a relationship that can increase sales and productivity.
* Deployed propensity model to identify target group for the next campaign based on past customer responses to previous initiatives.
